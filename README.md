# swbeanstalk

A beanstalkd client base on swoole coroutine.

Please check the example folder for usage instructions.

This repo will add some new features and code improvements inspired by Pheanstalk.

If you don't plan to use Swoole, Pheanstalk is the way to go for working with Beanstalk.

I could go the other way and add new Swoole Socket client for Pheanstalk but I found swbeanstalk to be much simpler and
easier to modify for my need.
